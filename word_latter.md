Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and list of English words, return
the shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:
Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not
a transformed word.
begin: hit
end: hat
begin: hit
...
...
...
end: cog
Note:

- Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.
